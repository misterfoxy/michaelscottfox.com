In 2015, I had to stop attending college due to financial hardship. Getting a loan was a big fear of mine, as I was fortunate to have parents that would explain things like APR's and credit scores to me early on. 

So, I stumbled into a restaurant job as a 20 year old. Within 4 months, I was opening and closing the shift as a lead bartender. Margaritas, palomas, and tequila shots were the game. Money was good, and I was able to save up to try something different.

A coding boot camp. 

I always had a passion for computers, and started teaching myself to build *good* websites a while earlier. I felt a boot camp could help propel me forward in that career path. 

It did, and at the end of 2017, I found myself writing code full time as a software developer. My team was small, and we weren't mighty, but god damnit if we didn't built a functional CRM tool. 

4 months into working there, on my birthday, my senior said to me: "You're 22?"

*"Yeah"*

**"Go back to school."**

I wasn't necessairly enjoying the commute from Tempe to Peoria (40 miles) and I had received an offer from my Boot Camp Program Manager to come join her team, and grow the support arm of the organization.

Soon after, our company acquired another coding boot camp. I was tasked with helping run a pilot that involves their product. 3 weeks before my 23rd birthday, I was in San Francisco on a business trip to strategize on integrations. 

2 months later, I wake up to this headline on linkedin: 

> 2U Inc. to buy Trilogy Education for $750 Million

This meant my stock, while minimal compared to others, was worth something. Some people made a lot more, some people made a lot less, but the average Joe and Jane got a fair share of the pie.

Work didn't change much at Trilogy X 2U, and still has a similar energy and culture. 

This worked in my favor because I was attending ASU all the while, and thanks to the terrific work-life balance of these companies, I'm going to get that degree like my Senior told me. 

Then, about a year later of S.S.D.D, the world goes into a **fucking global pandemic**. New words like social distancing and shelter-in-place are everywhere. Every retail establishment closes down. Restaurants and bars are closing left and right. Universities and gyms scramble to get classes running online. 

And what do I get paid to do at this time? 

Work remotely to help run online classes.

I went to Lutheran School, but I'm not necessairly religious. I'm kinda spiritual, but you'll never find a crystal or tarot card in my home. 

But every know and then, I get the feeling that somebody is looking out for me.
