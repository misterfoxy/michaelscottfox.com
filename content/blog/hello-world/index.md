Populus now has Listers! 

Listers are our partners that actually produce the goods. When you pitch into an order for your favorite designer or event, your payment will immediately get routed to their [Stripe account](https://stripe.com/connect). With money in hand immediately, the printers spend less time waiting for checks to clear, and more time serving up hot designs. Huge shout-out to [Peak AZ Apparel](https://peakazapparel.com) for being our founding partner!
