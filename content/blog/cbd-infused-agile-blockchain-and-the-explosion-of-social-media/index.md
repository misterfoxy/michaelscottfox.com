# 2010s
The 10's will go down in history as the decade that society went digital. Magazines and newspapers began pivoting to web subscriptions. Music became quicker, and personalities became more flagrant in the face of society's conventions. Everything that can happen will happen, or already did happen. Didn't you see my retweet?

# Back in my day

Do you remember the early days of Facebook? Back in 2007, it was every highschool and college kids dream. You can add all of your friends, post pictures and be tagged together, _and_ like the post?

FOMO is what helped facebook catapult to the head of the race. Signing up and seeing a list of one, two, or three hundred of your friends pop up was enough to get anyone to commit. There was finally a place on the internet where people talk about what they're doing and connect with each other! The party was just getting started, and you're already here chugging fireball and throwing duck lips. 

However, all parties end. It's not a bad thing when a party ends, but it's bound to happen eventually. People get tired of each other and need space.

On Facebook, we've been locked in a  house party for the better part of 2 decades. It's no wonder everyones getting pissed off and having babies.

5G is here. AI in all it's buzzword glory is here. Blockchain is here, which while still in infancy, poses a potential paradigm shift in the exhange of goods and services.
