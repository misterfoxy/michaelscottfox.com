Amidst the controversy whirlwind of Russian interference, non-disclosed back alley meetings, sexual predators, and trade anxieties, a sole issue remains untouched.
Well, not entirely. CNN and Fox News will take care of anything I miss.

The issue I speak of is apparel ethics.

The garment industry has long been plagued with poor manufacturing environments, peasant wages, and cruelest of all, child labor. These children are robbed of their youthful innocence, and forced to work in hazardous sweatshops to satisfy the need for fast fashion.

The reason you can walk into Forever 21 or H&M and snag a “trendy” graphic tee for $12 is because you aren’t getting the short end of the stick. You’re being manipulated by brand loyalty and propaganda marketing. You feel at ease giving up your hard earned cash to MegaBux, Inc. even though you’re the same as the Bangladeshi girl who made it — a number.

>“I’m upset and wish things were different!” said everyone except for MegaBux.

### Who is this guy?

I became fairly interested in clothing and fashion in high school, primarily due to reddit’s r/mfa and a good graphic design teacher. I made a stupid shirt with massive WordArt style text and a low resolution Hubble photograph, assumed I completed my masterpiece, and went on with my life.

In college, I joined a fraternity. At Arizona State. It was awesome.

During my time there, I was given the unofficial title of “Shirt Guy,” and was responsible for designing, ordering, and distributing custom apparel.

I took great pride in my work, and it reflected in our products. I taught myself vector graphics editing to make the designs myself, rather than pay an agency. I’ve built accounts with local screen printers and wholesalers to keep prices low on blank apparel.

Operationally speaking, today’s economy is largely conducted through magic black screens, as it’s easier to solve problems with a computer than pen and paper. It is difficult to collect money from 10–120 college kids, and even more difficult to distribute the finished good. It’s difficult to have a large group agree upon a design. It’s difficult for me to keep track of my orders in a single spreadsheet.

### Software Renaissance
In late 2016, I reignited my interest in computers. An incredible website called freecodecamp had resources and exercises galore for my new hobby — Web Development. I would stay up for hours on end working on algorithm challenges and loved every minute. My childhood interest in technology was evolving into a passion for making the magic box talk.

Several months later, I enrolled in a coding boot-camp through the University of Arizona. We met 3 times a week for 6 months and hammered away at our keyboards to improve our skills. Our final project was to build a full-fledged “minimum viable product,” and I opted to target my old field — crowdfunding custom apparel.

### Elevator Pitch
The need for simple, and inexpensive, apparel solutions is great.

I developed an app called Populus. It’s designed to distribute custom apparel as cheap and efficient as possible. Instead of users collecting money individually, anyone with an account can “commit” to purchasing something by an expiration date. If enough people have committed, the charges will be automatically made. If the minimum is not met, nobody gets charged, and the order is cancelled.

It’s a massive work-in-progress, but it’s mine. It’s the product of scratching my head month after month in front of a terminal. I get to design the shirts, because it’s my aspiration. I wrote in easter eggs all over the website, because it’s mine. 

I know what my passion is, and every day is a new chance to move my dreams forward.
