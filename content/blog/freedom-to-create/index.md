In January of 2019, I launched a web app I built to help grow an apparel side-hustle I'd been working on. It's been a tremendous learning experience for me, as I get to combine a lot of my passions to a single operation. 

I got to design cool apparel, and sell hundreds of units at a time. 

I got to negotiate with suppliers, manufacturers, and organizations to determine pricing and margins. 

I got to write code that would be used by over 700 people. 

I got to donate a few thousand dollars to charity. 

Here's a few things I learned this year.

1. Budget your Time and Money

Entrepreneurship and weightlifting have a lot in common. If you want to get big, you have to feverously track the little things. I subscribe to the lean startup philosophy, and tend to believe it's more important to focus on the product experience than buying 10 different domains for business ideas. Every dollar spent has to be recouped at some point, so frugality should always be your guiding principal in personal finance. 

I'm still in undergrad, and I work a full time job. This puts my free time at a minimum. My social life is nonexistent outside of work friends and long calls with the manufacturers. However, the guy who created the website that taught me to code tweeted this:

...and I haven't looked back. The beautiful thing about running your own business is that you get to make money your way. For me, this means building apps to help run engaging fundraisers. 

Some days, my time has to be spent more on the books or at the office. Using tools like GoogleCalendar 

2. Find Healthy & Creative Outlets

Play music. Hit the gym. Learn to cook. 

Coding and graphic design helped make Populus. You never know what your passions will bring you.

3. If you want to go fast, do it alone. If you want to go far, do it together.

It's all about the team you work with.
